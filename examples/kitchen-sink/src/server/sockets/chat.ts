A topic-style broadcast: anyone with the import can publish or
subscribe. `history: 100` retains the last 100 messages and replays
them to new subscribers. `clientPublish` is left off (default false)
so browsers can't publish directly — publish flows through publishChat
which validates input and runs server-side. The attached schema
validates publish payloads synchronously. Sockets aren't exposed to
MCP — only schema-bearing rpcs (tools) and prompts are (see /mcp).
