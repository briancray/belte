/*
A topic-style broadcast: anyone with the import can publish or
subscribe. `history: 100` retains the last 100 messages and replays
them to new subscribers. `clientPublish` is left off (default false)
so browsers can't publish directly — publish flows through publishChat
which validates input and runs server-side. The attached schema
validates publish payloads synchronously and auto-exposes the socket to
MCP and the CLI as a `chat-tail` read tool/command (recent buffered
messages); a `chat-publish` would also appear if `clientPublish` were on.
