Reuses the rpc cache machinery for an upstream API. `global: true` puts the
entry in the process-level store so a value fetched for one request is reused
by later requests (per-user request scoping is wrong here — the upstream is
shared); `ttl` bounds staleness so the upstream is hit at most once per minute
across the whole process. Same dedup/ttl/invalidate/pending machinery the rpc
verbs get — only the Response-based SSR streaming snapshot is unavailable,
since an external fetch carries no wire metadata to snapshot.

Invalidate this upstream from anywhere with cache.invalidate(fetchRates) — the
selector matches the producer's id prefix, so the next read refetches. Works
only once fetchRates has been cached at least once (before that it has no id).
