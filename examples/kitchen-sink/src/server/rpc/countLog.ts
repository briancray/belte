JSONL streaming over plain HTTP — one JSON object per line. Best when
the consumer is itself another script (logs, large result sets, bulk
exports) rather than a browser's EventSource. Clients read the
Response body via `.raw(args)` and parse with TextDecoderStream + a
split-by-newline reduce.

The `inputSchema` makes this read-only stream reachable beyond the
browser: as the CLI command `countLog --to=5` (frames print as NDJSON)
and as an MCP tool `countLog` (frames drain into `structuredContent`).
