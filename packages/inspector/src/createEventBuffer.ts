/*
A bounded ring of recent log records plus a live listener set. The framework's
single log tap feeds push(); each connected events stream replays the tail it
hasn't seen (by sequence id) then subscribes for new records. Capacity-bounded
so a long-lived server can't grow the buffer without limit — the inspector is a
tail, not a store (ADR 0004). Generic over the record so the package forwards
them opaquely as JSON, free of belte's internal LogRecord type.

`epoch` is minted per buffer instance: a dev worker swap creates a fresh buffer
whose ids restart at 1, so a client reconnecting with the previous worker's
Last-Event-ID must replay the tail rather than silently filter everything out —
the epoch is how the stream detects that mismatch.
