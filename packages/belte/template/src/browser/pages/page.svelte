Top-level await runs on the server during SSR. The decoded body is captured
into the per-request cache, serialized into the HTML, and replayed on the
client during hydration — no second fetch. `cache(fn)()` returns the
Content-Type-decoded value (JSON object, string, or Blob); reach for
`.raw(args)` if you need the underlying Response.
