Resolve config into process.env before anything reads it (createServer reads
PORT, app code reads Bun.env.*). Standalone-only: data-dir first so the user's
saved config wins over the binary-dir shipped default; both back-fill only what
the shell didn't already set. A bundle launched via `open` has cwd `/`, so the
data-dir `.env` is how it gets its config at all. Under `bun dev`/`bun start`
these bundle layers don't apply — the project's own CWD `.env` (Bun-autoloaded)
is the config — so loading them would let a stray data-dir `PORT` defeat dev's
port scan.

import (not a static top-level one) so it runs after the merge above, not at
