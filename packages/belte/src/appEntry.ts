/*
Compiled bundle launcher entry — the executable a bundle runs. Instead of a blank
window it boots into a connect screen, letting the user either connect to a remote
server by URL or start the embedded server binary that ships beside this launcher.

The connect screen is served by a tiny control server, but that server can't live
on this main thread: `openWebview` calls `webview_run`, a native UI loop that
blocks the thread (and its JS event loop) until the window closes, so an
in-process `Bun.serve` would never answer. The control server runs in a Worker
instead (see controlServerWorker.ts) and hands back the origin to point the window
at; it also owns the embedded-server child and the native menu flag, since neither
can be driven from a main thread frozen inside webview_run.

Bun doesn't apply this build's plugins to the worker entry, so the worker can't
import belte's virtual modules; this entry imports them (the connect-screen HTML,
the app title) and passes them in the worker's `init` message.

The window owns the main thread; on close we tell the worker to reap its child.

Derive the config form's JSON Schema here (the worker can't import the virtual

Spawn the control server worker. `__BELTE_WORKER_ENTRY__` is the worker's absolute
path, injected by bundleApp via Bun's `define` so the specifier is a static literal
at build time — that's what makes `bun build --compile` embed the worker module
into the standalone binary. A relative specifier resolves against the build's cwd
(the consumer project), not this file, so it isn't found; a
`new URL(..., import.meta.url)` specifier isn't embedded at all.

while it boots/probes (the OS shows the launching dock icon meanwhile).

already returns to the connect screen, whose form is the place to point at another
server. Roled items are launcher-only, so they carry an extra field the public
BundleMenuItem type doesn't advertise — modelled here with a local type and bridged
