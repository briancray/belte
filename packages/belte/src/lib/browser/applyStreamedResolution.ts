Settles one streamed resolution against its placeholder. A snapshot overwrites
the placeholder with a warm entry (so re-renders and later reads are sync) and
fires an invalidate to re-run any read mounted before it arrived; a miss
re-fetches the request live. Either way it resolves the deferred so a {#await}
already awaiting the placeholder promise unblocks, and removes it from the
registry so a later flush only touches genuine leftovers.
