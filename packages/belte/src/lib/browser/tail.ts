/*
Reactive consumer for streaming sources. Takes a Subscribable<T> — the shape
both `Socket<T>` (declared under src/server/sockets/) and the result of
`fn.stream(args)` satisfy:

  const latest = $derived(tail(chat))                      // socket, latest frame
  const recent = $derived(tail(chat, { last: 20 }))        // live window of the last ≤20
  const tick   = $derived(tail(tickFeed.stream()))         // rpc stream

The bare form is latest-wins: T | undefined, pending until the first frame.
The window form returns T[] — `[]` while pending, never undefined — holding
the last ≤`last` frames however they arrived. Seeding rides the source's
optional retention capability (`Subscribable.tail(count)`): a socket declared
`{ tail: n }` replays up to `last` retained frames (1 for the bare form — a
latest-wins reader only needs the newest); a source without the capability
(rpc stream, undeclared socket) starts live-only. tail() never requires
retention — the window semantics are identical either way, only how much
past it can show differs.

Lifecycle mirrors cache(): the entry's tracker is a Svelte createSubscriber,
so the first $derived read in a tracking scope opens the underlying iterator
and the last $derived to stop reading closes it. Many $deriveds reading the
same source share one underlying subscription — the registry dedupes by
`subscribable.name`, with `last` folded into the key, so the bare form and
each window size are independent subscriptions. Passing fresh `fn.stream(args)`
Subscribables across re-renders is safe: same args → same key → shared
subscription. tail.error / tail.status take the same options to address the
same entry.

Reconnect-with-retained-value: a transport loss (the typed
SocketDisconnectedError, raised only by the ws channel — an rpc stream is a
one-shot Response and never disconnects) does not surface as an error. The
entry keeps its window, flags `refreshing` (the probe contract: value held,
fresher source in flight — never merely `open`), and re-invokes the source;
the channel's backoff owns the retry. The reopened source's replay commits
over the window atomically at the `replayed` boundary (TailHooks) — appended
it would duplicate, rebuilt frame-by-frame it would flash — and an empty
replay keeps the held window, with live frames appending after. For the
bare form the commit is exactly latest-wins convergence. Initial opens seed
the same way, so a window's first paint is the full seed, not a staircase.

tail is a no-op on the server (returns undefined / []) — SSR can't keep a
stream open across the request boundary. Pages that want a seeded value in
the initial HTML should fetch via cache() against an HTTP rpc handler and
layer tail() on top for live updates after hydration.

Errors are surfaced through tail.error(x) rather than thrown, so reading
from a $derived can't crash the component. Status distinguishes "haven't
received the first frame" (pending) from "stream ended cleanly" (done) and
"wire layer surfaced an error" (error).
