/*
Client-side substitute for a server-declared Socket. The bundler emits
one call per socket export under `src/server/sockets/`: server target uses
defineSocket (real fan-out), browser target uses socketProxy (subscribe
over the multiplexed ws channel). Both paths produce identical Socket
shapes so user code reads the same on either side.

The Socket surface — bare iteration as the live stream, `.tail(n)` seeded
from the retained tail, `.publish` sending a server-validated `pub` frame —
is built by buildSocketOverChannel over the page's lazily-opened singleton
channel; this module only binds that builder to the browser channel so the
test harness can reuse the identical surface over its own channel.

Backpressure is unbounded — a slow consumer with a chatty socket will
grow the per-iterator buffer; bounded policies belong in a future
socketProxy API, not the wire layer.
