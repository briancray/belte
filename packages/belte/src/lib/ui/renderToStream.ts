/*
Out-of-order SSR streaming. Yields the pending shell first (so the browser paints
immediately), then one resolved fragment per await block as its promise settles —
in completion order, not source order, so a slow read never blocks a fast one.
Each resolved fragment is a `<belte-resolve data-id="ID" data-resume="…">…</belte-resolve>`
that `applyResolved` swaps into the matching `<!--belte:await:ID-->` boundary; the
`data-resume` payload is the JSON-serialized value, registered for hydration so an
`await` block adopts the resolved branch on resume instead of re-running.

This is the await-block-streams half of the cache rule: a top-level `await` in the
script would have blocked the shell (inlined), but an await *block* flushes its
shell now and streams the value when ready. Driven by a plain `render()` result,
so it composes with any transport (HTTP chunked, a socket frame, a test).

A `then` on the `await` tag makes the block BLOCKING: it settles before the first
flush, its resolved branch spliced into its (empty) boundary and its value seeded
into the resume manifest inline — so the value is in the first paint, no pending
shell, no swap. The first yield therefore awaits all blocking blocks; only the
remaining streaming blocks flush out of order after it.
