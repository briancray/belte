/*
Out-of-order SSR streaming. Yields the pending shell first (so the browser paints
immediately), then one resolved fragment per await block as its promise settles —
in completion order, not source order, so a slow read never blocks a fast one.
Each resolved fragment is a `<belte-resolve data-id="ID">…</belte-resolve>` that
`applyResolved` swaps into the matching `<!--belte:await:ID-->` boundary.

This is the await-block-streams half of the cache rule: a top-level `await` in the
script would have blocked the shell (inlined), but an await *block* flushes its
shell now and streams the value when ready. Driven by a plain `render()` result,
so it composes with any transport (HTTP chunked, a socket frame, a test).
