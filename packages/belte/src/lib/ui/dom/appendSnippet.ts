/*
A `{snippet(args)}` interpolation: mount the branded builder's nodes at this
position. The builder builds straight into `parent` — sequential build order
places it correctly among siblings, and its effects join the surrounding
component scope (so they tear down with it). The body's reactive reads update
fine-grained via those effects; an enclosing `each` re-mounts on list changes.

On hydrate the builder runs against the server-rendered nodes between the
`<!--belte:snippet-->`/`<!--/belte:snippet-->` markers — its `openChild`/`appendText`
claim them in place. The cursor is advanced past the open marker before, and past
the close marker after, so the markers themselves are skipped.
