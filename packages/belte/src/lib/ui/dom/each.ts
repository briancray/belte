/*
Keyed list binding — the runtime for `<template each key=>`. An effect tracks
`items()`; on change it reconciles the parent's children to the new sequence by
key: a new key renders a row in its own ownership scope (so the row's bindings
dispose when it leaves), a departed key disposes and is removed, and surviving
rows are moved into place with `insertBefore`. Keying by identity (not index) is
what lets a row keep its node and inner effects across a reorder — the same
reason the document addresses list entities by key, not position.
