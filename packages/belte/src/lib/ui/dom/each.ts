/*
Keyed list binding — the runtime for `<template each key=>`. Rows live in their own
region, bounded by a trailing anchor so positioning is relative to the each itself,
never `parent.firstChild` — a sibling before the each (e.g. a static nav link) must
not be treated as the first row. An effect tracks `items()` and reconciles by key:
a new key renders a row in its own ownership scope (so the row's bindings dispose
when it leaves), surviving rows are moved before the anchor in list order, and a
departed key disposes and is removed. Keying by identity (not index) lets a row
keep its node and inner effects across a reorder.

On hydrate the SSR rows are already in place and in order: claim each one where it
sits (no reordering), park the anchor after them, and skip the first reconcile.
