/*
Async binding — the runtime for `<template await>`. Renders the pending branch,
then swaps to the resolved branch (with the value) or the error branch on settle.

The read runs inside a belte-ui `effect`, so it's reactive: `belte/shared/cache`'s
store subscribes the key it reads to this effect (createSubscriber is belte-ui-
native), so `cache.invalidate()` of that key re-runs the block — pending, then the
fresh value swaps in. A read that touches no reactive source runs exactly once.

Hydration adopts in place, by precedence:
  1. a streamed resume value (`RESUME[id]`) → adopt the resolved branch the stream
     swapped in, no read (the promise never runs — a plain producer resume);
  2. a warm-sync read (a warm `cache()` entry returns synchronously) → adopt the
     SSR branch with that value, and the read registered the key so it stays live;
  3. otherwise (genuinely pending) → discard the SSR boundary and run fresh.
After the first (adopting) run, later invalidations swap content before an anchor
parked just after the adopted node.
