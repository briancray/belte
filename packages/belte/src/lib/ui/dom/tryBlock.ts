/*
Synchronous error boundary — the runtime for `<template try>`. Builds the guarded
subtree (`renderTry`); if building it throws — including a throw from an initial
reactive read, since effects run during build — it tears down the partial scope
and builds `renderCatch(error)` instead. Both branches are a range of element
roots tracked together. No `renderCatch` (no `<template catch>`) re-throws, so the
error propagates to the nearest enclosing boundary (or the server 500 / stream).

Catches throws during the BUILD of the subtree (mount, hydrate adoption, and the
initial reactive reads). A throw in a later effect re-run is outside this lexical
build and is not caught here.

On hydrate it claims the SSR boundary (`<!--belte:try:N-->…<!--/belte:try:N-->`):
the happy path adopts the guarded nodes in place; a throw discards the boundary's
server nodes and builds the catch fresh.
