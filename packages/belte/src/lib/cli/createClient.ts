/*
Each property of the client is a callable: invoking it decodes the body
(plain call), while `.raw(args)` returns the underlying Response without
decoding or throwing on non-2xx — the escape hatch the CLI uses to sniff
the Content-Type and stream sse/jsonl bodies frame-by-frame instead of
buffering through decodeResponse. buildRpcProxy owns that invoker contract.
*/
type AnyApi = Record<string, RpcInvoker>

/*
Builds a typed proxy over the project's RPCs for use in scripts, tests,
server-to-server calls, and the standalone CLI binary. Modes are
decided at construction:

  - With `url`: remote-mode. Each property access becomes an HTTP call
    against `<url>/<manifest[name].url>` using the manifest's method.
    Auth header is set from `token` when provided.
  - Without `url`: in-process mode. Each property access looks up the
    rpc in the registry (populated by importing the project's rpc
    modules) and calls `rpc.fetch(synthesizedRequest)` — same code
    path the HTTP router uses, no network hop.

The `manifest` is the bundler-emitted CLI manifest baked into the thin
binary. In in-process mode it's optional (registry is the source of
truth); in remote mode it supplies the method + url per command without
needing the rpc modules loaded. The mode is chosen solely by whether
`url` is set — the shipped CLI binary (see runCli) always passes `url`,
so it runs remote-only; in-process mode is for same-project scripts and
tests that import this directly without a `url`.
