The running bundle's per-user data dir — keyed by the same program name belte
uses for the user's `.env` and `last-connection.json`, so an app's DB/cache lands
beside belte's own config instead of a drifted sibling directory. cwd-independent:
the path derives from the bundler-injected program name, not the process working
directory (which `open` sets to `/`). Pure: computes the path, never touches the
filesystem.
