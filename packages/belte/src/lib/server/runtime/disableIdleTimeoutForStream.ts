/*
Opts a long-lived streaming response (SSE / JSONL) out of Bun's per-connection
idle timeout. Such a stream can stay quiet for longer than the 10s default
between frames, which Bun would otherwise read as an idle connection and close
mid-stream. `server.timeout(req, 0)` clears the timeout for just this in-flight
request, leaving the global default in place for ordinary traffic. Streaming is
detected by Content-Type (the shared signal the CLI/MCP drain paths use) rather
than `body instanceof ReadableStream`, since every bodied Response exposes one.

A streamed SSR page (`text/html`) is deliberately not opted out: it inherits the
configured `idleTimeout` as a bounded cap on how long it can hold the connection,
and the client re-fetches any placeholder left unresolved by a cut stream (see
flushUnresolvedPlaceholders). Non-stream responses pass through.
