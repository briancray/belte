/*
Awaits one cache entry and turns it into a wire-safe snapshot, or undefined
when it can't ship. Shared by the inline snapshot path (settled entries,
resolves immediately) and the streaming drain (pending {#await} entries,
resolves whenever the underlying fetch lands). Only replayable methods (see
REPLAYABLE_METHODS) with a textual Content-Type survive — writes must not
re-fire from a snapshot, body-carrying methods can't be replayed without the
original request body, and binary bodies don't round-trip through JSON.

Reads the body once and replaces the entry's promise with a string-bodied
Response so later `shareable()` clones operate on a buffered body instead of
teeing the original stream. Returns undefined on a rejected fetch (the client
falls back to a live re-fetch on cache miss) or when the entry was evicted /
replaced between resolution and read (a concurrent invalidate) so the snapshot
never ships a key that no longer matches the live store.
