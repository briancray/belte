/*
Boot-time disclosure for an unguarded MCP endpoint: when /__belte/mcp is
mounted with at least one MCP-exposed declaration and no app.handle
middleware to authenticate requests, say so. Printed unconditionally — the
surface map is DEBUG-gated diagnostics, but an unauthenticated machine
surface should never boot silently. The caller skips this entirely when
app.handle exists, so only the authless path pays the eager registry load.
Best-effort like the surface map: enumeration failures are swallowed.
