/*
The out-of-band resolution stream. The browser opens this once per streamed page
(token from `__SSR__.streamToken`) and reads newline-delimited StreamedResolution
objects as each pending {#await} fetch lands — draining the SAME in-flight
promises stashed during SSR, so handlers run once. A missing/expired token
(404) tells the client to re-fetch its placeholders live.

Returned directly (not via dispatchRequest), so it inherits the configured
`idleTimeout` as a bounded cap rather than the long-lived-stream disable; a cut
is recovered client-side off the fetch reader's clean EOF.
