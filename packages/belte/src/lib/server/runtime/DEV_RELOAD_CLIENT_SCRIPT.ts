/*
Dev-only live-reload client, injected into the served shell when the server
runs under `belte dev`. It opens an EventSource to /__belte/dev; each
connection's first event carries the worker's client fingerprint — everything
the browser consumes (devClientFingerprint). The channel only drops when the
dev orchestrator swaps the server after a rebuild, and on reconnect the page
reloads only if the fingerprint changed: a server-only edit keeps the page,
and its UI state, alive. Self-managed retry keeps the gap short instead of
relying on EventSource's multi-second default backoff.

Hidden tabs hold no connection: the channel closes on `visibilitychange:
hidden` and reopens on visible, where the reconnect's first event carries
whatever the current worker announces — a rebuild that happened while the tab
slept still reloads it. The initial connect runs even when the page loads
hidden (the baseline must be the serving worker's fingerprint, captured before
a swap can replace it) and releases itself once that first event lands.
