/*
Cross-request holding area bridging an SSR render to its out-of-band resolution
stream. When a page flushes with pending {#await} reads, renderPage stashes the
request-scoped cache store plus its in-flight entries here under a random token
and ships the token in `__SSR__`. The browser then opens the resolve endpoint,
which TAKES the stash and awaits those SAME promises — so the handlers run once,
not again, even though the resolve stream is a separate request.

The SSR request scope exits as soon as the buffered document is sent, but the
stash holds a reference so the store (and its in-flight promises) survive until
the resolve stream drains them. A TTL evicts stashes whose client never connects
(JS disabled, navigated away before hydration) so they can't leak.
