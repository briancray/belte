/*
The reachability registry behind `belte/server/reachable`. A probe transport
and the timings are injected so the public name wires them from env + a real
HEAD while tests drive scripted outcomes on tiny intervals.

Per origin, the first read awaits one real probe (the FAITHFUL first answer —
its latency, including a full timeout when the host is down, is the price of
not guessing) and then hands the origin to a createLivenessWatch that re-probes
every `intervalMs` to keep the value warm. Every later read resolves instantly
off that warm value, fresh within one interval — the faithful cost is paid once.

The inaugural probe runs DIRECTLY, not through the watch: the watch's
failureLimit (anti-flap) is right for the ongoing poll but would make a down
host take failureLimit× the timeout to answer on the first call. The watch's
injected probe doubles as the idle reaper — a host nobody has read in `idleMs`
stops polling (stop() during the probe changes the watched url, so the watch
discards the result and never reschedules); the next read restarts it cold.
