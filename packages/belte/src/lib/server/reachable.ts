/*
Server-only outbound reachability for an external host. `await reachable(host)`
HEADs the host's origin: the first call awaits a real probe (faithful — a down
host costs the full timeout, an up host one handshake) and starts a background
poll that re-probes every TTL, so every later call resolves instantly off the
warm value, fresh within one TTL. A down host going down is caught within
~failureLimit polls; recovery flips it back automatically.

  if (!(await reachable('api.example.com'))) return error(503)

A bare host defaults to https; pass an explicit http://… for a non-TLS host.
Answers "can I connect to this host," NOT "is my endpoint healthy": any
completed HTTP response (even 4xx/5xx, even a 405 to HEAD) counts as reachable;
only a connection failure or timeout reads as unreachable. There is no ambient
server-side connectivity signal, so this is the honest way to fail a doomed
outbound call fast — see online() for the inbound/client-reported counterpart.

BELTE_REACHABLE_TTL (poll cadence / freshness, ms) and BELTE_REACHABLE_TIMEOUT
(per-HEAD bound, ms) tune the defaults; the timeout is deliberately generous so
a healthy-but-distant host over a slow link is not mis-read as down.
