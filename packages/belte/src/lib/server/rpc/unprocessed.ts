Rpc helpers (GET / POST / …) are placeholders — the bundler rewrites every
`export const x = GET(fn)` inside `src/server/rpc/<file>.ts` into a call to
defineRpc (server target) or remoteProxy (client target). If a call slips
through, the bundler plugin didn't process the file; throwing here surfaces
that cleanly instead of silently returning undefined.
