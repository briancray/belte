/*
One operation a socket exposes to the non-browser surfaces. A socket
always offers a `tail` (read recent / stream live) and, when
`clientPublish` is set, a `publish` (send a message). This is the shared
skeleton — name, kind, HTTP face — that the CLI manifest, the MCP tool
list, and the MCP dispatcher all read instead of re-deriving the naming
convention and existence rule independently. Each surface dresses it with
its own presentation (descriptions, input schema, annotations).
