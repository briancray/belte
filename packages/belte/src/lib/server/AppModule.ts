/*
Optional hooks exported from src/app.ts. All hooks are optional; defaults
kick in when an export is missing. init returns an optional cleanup
function that runs on SIGINT/SIGTERM. handle is single-middleware with
next so user code can mutate the response or branch on the URL.

WebSockets are not exposed here — belte's only native WebSocket
surface is the sockets hub (see `belte/server/socket`), multiplexed onto a
single framework-owned connection per client at `/__belte/sockets`.
Inside request scopes, the live Bun.Server is reachable via the
exported `server()` function from `belte/server`; `init` receives it
explicitly because it runs outside a request.

    of `handle` (the endpoint must answer without auth — reporting
    "authenticated: false" requires exactly that), so the request arrives
    unfiltered: cookies are readable, nothing is guaranteed valid. The
    payload is public and unauthenticated — never put secrets in it. The
    framework's identity keys (belte/name/version) win on collision; a

    can't masquerade as an unreachable server. Keep it cheap: the client
