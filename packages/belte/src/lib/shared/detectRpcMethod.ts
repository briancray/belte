/*
Reads the HTTP method of an $rpc module from its source. Every file under
src/server/rpc/ follows the convention `export const <name> = GET(fn)` (the
rpc helper picks the method, possibly with an explicit generic
`GET<{…}>(fn)`), so the helper name at the export is the method. Returns
undefined when no rpc export matches — the caller skips the file rather
than guessing. Used by the rpc.d.ts codegen to type url() against
query-carrying rpcs; matching the same convention the bundler rewrites
keeps the two from drifting.
