/*
Resolves a fn selector to the key prefix its entries share: a remote keys on
method+url (fn and fn.raw agree — same wire identity), a producer on the
reference id minted at first cache. With `args`, the exact entry key for that
one call instead — derived through the same encoders the read path uses
(keyForRemoteCall / producerKey format), so selector and entry can't
disagree. Undefined when no prefix exists — bare and tag selectors (they
scan, not prefix-match) and producers never cached (no id was minted;
minting one here would leak identities for probe-only reads). The
cache()-wrapper throw lives here so both consumers — the matcher and the
probes' channel tap — reject it before subscribing to anything.
