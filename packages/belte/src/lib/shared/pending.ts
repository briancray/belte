/*
Reactive in-flight probe over both registries — the cache (calls) and the
tail registry (streams). Pending means "no value yet":
  pending()              → any call in flight, or any registered stream
                           awaiting its first frame (global activity bar)
  pending(fn)            → that function's calls (per-route spinner; remote or
                           producer, same selector grammar as cache.invalidate)
  pending(fn, args)      → exactly that call (per-row spinner)
  pending({ scope })     → a tagged group
  pending(subscribable)  → that stream awaiting its first frame
                           (tail.status === 'pending'; true when nothing
                           is reading yet — there is no value either way)
Probes report, never act: reading one opens no fetch and no stream. SSR
loading state is driven by {#await}, not this. Scan semantics (tap order,
selector grammar, registry spans) live in probeRegistries.
