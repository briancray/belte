/*
Registry-wide lifecycle tap shared by the cache store and the tail registry:
one "membership or state changed" signal for the pending()/refreshing()
probes, which match many entries (or all) and re-derive by scanning, so they
need a single channel rather than per-key granularity. track() inside a
tracking scope ($derived / $effect) re-runs that scope on every mark();
outside one it is a no-op. The subscriber is created lazily on the first
tracked read and self-evicts when its last reader tears down,
identity-guarded so a concurrent re-track isn't clobbered. mark() is a plain
callback — the channel only ever has the one memoized listener, so no
EventTarget dispatch is needed.

mark() defers its notify to a microtask: registry mutations happen inside
consumer read paths, and the documented read idiom is `$derived(await
cache(fn)())` — a cold read there registers an entry mid-derived, where
writing the subscriber's version source throws state_unsafe_mutation. The
probes scan the registry at re-derive time, so a deferred ping reads state
that is already current; marks within one tick coalesce into one notify.
