/*
HTTP statuses that mean "the server didn't process this request" — the gateway /
availability family. A response with one of these is treated like a transport failure
by a durable RPC: the call still throws (the error framework is unchanged), and the
request is parked for replay on recovery. Everything else (4xx, 500, …) means the
server received and handled it — that flows to the error framework, never the outbox.

  502 Bad Gateway · 503 Service Unavailable · 504 Gateway Timeout (belte's own client
  timeout surfaces here too) · 520–527, 530 — Cloudflare/CDN origin-unreachable.
