Reader-driven lifecycle (the createSubscriber rule): the first tracking
reader starts the poll, the last one tears it down — an app that never
reads health() never sends a byte. Mirrors the socket channel's visibility
philosophy: hidden tabs hold no poll (nobody is looking at the banner),
and the visible transition probes immediately so the value is honest the
moment eyes return. The online event also probes immediately — recovery
confirmation shouldn't wait out the interval; offline needs no probe
because read-time composition with navigator.onLine reports it instantly.
