Read-only (safe) HTTP methods — they don't mutate server state. Belte
uses this to decide which rpcs auto-expose to MCP: reads flip MCP on
when a schema is present, mutations require an explicit `clients.mcp`
opt-in so a model can't delete/overwrite data just because the handler
carries a schema. Also feeds the MCP tool `readOnlyHint` annotation.
