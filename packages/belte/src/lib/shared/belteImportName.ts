/*
Resolves the bare specifier prefix a consuming project imports belte under —
the name belte is installed as in its package.json. A project may depend on
belte directly (`@belte/belte`) or behind a package alias
(`"belte": "npm:@belte/belte@..."`, or `workspace:@belte/belte@*`
inside this repo). An alias-only install resolves only under the alias key and
a direct install only under the canonical name, so the generated rpc / socket
/ prompt modules must import under whichever name the project
declared.

Prefers a `belte` alias (the ergonomic surface the docs use) when present, then
a direct canonical dependency, then any other alias targeting belte. Falls back
to the canonical name when belte isn't found in package.json — the build can't
resolve belte at all in that case, and the canonical name yields the clearest
resolution error.
