/*
Curries a call against a cache store. `cache(fn, options?)` returns an invoker;
calling that invoker with args checks the store for a prior entry and returns a
shared promise on hit, or invokes `fn` once and stores its promise on miss.
Splitting configuration (the outer call) from invocation (the inner call) keeps
options anchored in a fixed position so they can't collide with arg shapes. TTL
= undefined → forever; ttl = 0 → dedupe only; ttl > 0 → entry expires `ttl` ms
after the promise resolves.

`fn` is either a remote function (a GET/POST/... helper) or a plain producer
returning a Promise:

  cache(getPost)({ id })       // → Promise<Post>      (decoded body)
  cache(getPost.raw)({ id })   // → Promise<Response>  (raw escape hatch)
  cache(fetchRates)()          // → Promise<Rates>     (plain producer)

Remote calls key on fn.method + fn.url + args and store the underlying Response
(the decoded view is derived on the way out for the non-raw variant; both share
one entry). Producers have no wire identity, so they key on the producer's
reference + args — pass a hoisted/stable function to dedupe (an inline arrow is a
new reference every call and never does), and the promise is stored and handed
back as-is (no Response, no decode, no SSR snapshot).

`options.global` puts the entry in the process-level store instead of the
request-scoped one, so a value computed in one request is reused by later
requests — the memoise-an-external-endpoint case. Default (omitted) is
request-scoped on the server, which keeps per-user data from leaking across
requests; on the client there is one tab store either way, so it is a no-op.

Reactivity is implicit: the invoker calls `store.subscribe(key)`, which
registers the surrounding $derived / $effect scope. Invalidating the key
then re-runs that scope, which calls cache() again and gets a fresh entry.
Outside a tracking scope subscribe() is a no-op, so cache() works the same
in server code and plain client code.

SSR: how you consume the call decides inline vs streaming, per Svelte's
documented {#await} rule (only the pending branch renders during SSR):

  const post = await cache(getPost)({ id })   // blocks render → baked into
                                              // the initial SSR HTML
  {#await cache(getPost)({ id })}             // renders pending → shell flushes
                                              // now, value streams in on the
                                              // same response when it resolves

The two don't mix within one component. A top-level `await` flips Svelte's
async render into await-everything mode and sweeps in every promise created
in that same component instance — so a sibling {#await} (or a
<svelte:boundary pending>) gets awaited and inlined too, buffering the whole
response to the slowest read. The markup form doesn't change this: a boundary
renders its pending branch but render() still blocks. To get both on one page,
isolate each blocking (top-level await) read in its own child component and
keep streaming reads in a parent that never top-level awaits — the
await-everything mode is per component instance, so a child's await blocks only
the child.

        the SSR DOM. Raw callers always take the Response path. After an
        invalidate the replacement entry carries no value and falls through
        to the async fetch as before.

        The public overload stays typed Promise<Return> on purpose: a
        non-thenable is the only thing {#await} can render synchronously, so
        the sync return is left as an internal optimization rather than
        widened to `Return | Promise<Return>` (which would leak it into every
        caller's types). The one cost is that `.then`/`.catch`/`.finally`
        directly on a warm result throws — consume cache via `await`/`{#await}`,
        never `.then`. Don't "fix" the type; see memory cache-warm-sync-tradeoff.

        Each warm read returns its own clone of the stored value: the entry's
        value is decoded once at hydration and would otherwise be handed by
        reference to every component reading the key, so one reader mutating
        it would corrupt the others and the hydrated state. A live fetch hands
        each reader a freshly-decoded object, so cloning keeps warm reads
        consistent with that. The clone is synchronous, preserving the
        {#await}-renders-without-suspension property.
