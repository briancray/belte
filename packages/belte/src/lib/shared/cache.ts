/*
Curries a call against a cache store. `cache(fn, options?)` returns an invoker;
calling that invoker with args checks the store for a prior entry and returns a
shared promise on hit, or invokes `fn` once and stores its promise on miss.
Splitting configuration (the outer call) from invocation (the inner call) keeps
options anchored in a fixed position so they can't collide with arg shapes. TTL
= undefined → forever; ttl = 0 → dedupe only; ttl > 0 → entry expires `ttl` ms
after the promise resolves.

Coalescing is always on: identical in-flight calls share one flight, so
`cache(createPost, { ttl: 0 })` is the mutation idiom — double-submit
coalescing and pending() visibility with nothing retained beyond the store's
atomic unit (the whole request on the server: one render, one effect; the
in-flight window in the tab). Caching is the retention `ttl` adds on top.

`fn` is either a remote function (a GET/POST/... helper) or a plain producer
returning a Promise:

  cache(getPost)({ id })       // → Promise<Post>      (decoded body)
  cache(getPost.raw)({ id })   // → Promise<Response>  (raw escape hatch)
  cache(fetchRates)()          // → Promise<Rates>     (plain producer)

Remote calls key on fn.method + fn.url + args and store the underlying Response
(the decoded view is derived on the way out for the non-raw variant; both share
one entry). Producers have no wire identity, so they key on the producer's
reference + args — pass a hoisted/stable function to dedupe (an inline arrow is a
new reference every call and never does; a warning fires once per such call
site), and the promise is stored and handed back as-is (no Response, no decode,
no SSR snapshot).

`options.global` puts the entry in the process-level store instead of the
request-scoped one, so a value computed in one request is reused by later
requests — the memoise-an-external-endpoint case. Default (omitted) is
request-scoped on the server, which keeps per-user data from leaking across
requests; on the client there is one tab store either way, so it is a no-op.

Reactivity is implicit: the invoker calls `store.subscribe(key)`, which
registers the surrounding $derived / $effect scope. Invalidating the key
then re-runs that scope, which calls cache() again and gets a fresh entry.
Outside a tracking scope subscribe() is a no-op, so cache() works the same
in server code and plain client code.

SSR: how you consume the call decides inline vs streaming, per Svelte's
documented {#await} rule (only the pending branch renders during SSR):

  const post = await cache(getPost)({ id })   // blocks render → baked into
                                              // the initial SSR HTML
  {#await cache(getPost)({ id })}             // renders pending → shell flushes
                                              // now, value streams in on the
                                              // same response when it resolves

The two don't mix within one component. A top-level `await` flips Svelte's
async render into await-everything mode and sweeps in every promise created
in that same component instance — so a sibling {#await} (or a
<svelte:boundary pending>) gets awaited and inlined too, buffering the whole
response to the slowest read. The markup form doesn't change this: a boundary
renders its pending branch but render() still blocks. To get both on one page,
isolate each blocking (top-level await) read in its own child component and
keep streaming reads in a parent that never top-level awaits — the
await-everything mode is per component instance, so a child's await blocks only
the child.

        the SSR DOM. Raw callers always take the Response path. After an
        invalidate the replacement entry carries no value and falls through
        to the async fetch as before.

        The decoded overload is typed `Promise<Return> | Return` so the warm
        sync return is honest at the type level: a non-thenable is the only

        errors with `try/catch`, never `.catch`. Raw and producer callers stay
        `Promise<…>` — they never take this sync path.

        Each warm read returns its own clone of the stored value: the entry's
        value is decoded once at hydration and would otherwise be handed by
        reference to every component reading the key, so one reader mutating
        it would corrupt the others and the hydrated state. A live fetch hands
        each reader a freshly-decoded object, so cloning keeps warm reads

decode, subsequent ones are synchronous. Returns the keys touched so the on()

/*
Event-driven cache maintenance: subscribes to a Subscribable (socket or rpc
stream) and runs `handler` once per frame — the declarative home for "this
socket event stales that cached data", replacing the hand-rolled $effect +
tail() + edge-detection pattern. Bare iteration means live frames only
(ADR-0004): no replay seed, a frame is an event, nothing is retained.

Delivery is sequential: frame N+1 is not pulled until N's handler (sync or
async) settles, so ordering holds and before/after work sits naturally
between frames; a slow handler queues frames rather than racing itself.
The context's `invalidate` is this binding's scoped copy — same grammar and
effect as cache.invalidate, but each call is recorded in the binding's
coverage set (attribution by function identity, so it survives awaits).

On a transport loss (the typed SocketDisconnectedError) frames may have been
missed, and a missed frame is a missed invalidation — silently stale data. The
binding can't know what it missed, so it conservatively re-invalidates its
whole coverage set, then reopens the source (the channel's backoff owns retry
timing); over-invalidating costs a refetch, never correctness. A handler
throw is logged and the binding lives on — one bad frame must not detach
freshness; a server error frame or clean end is terminal, mirroring tail.

No-op on the server (inert dispose): SSR can't hold a stream across the
request boundary — bindings attach client-side, where the snapshot has
already seeded the cache. Dispose aborts `signal`, stops delivery, and
closes the subscription.
