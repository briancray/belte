/*
Headers belte forwards from an inbound HTTP/MCP request onto every
synthesized in-process rpc Request — cookies + bearer auth + the four
forwarding hints proxies set when terminating TLS in front of the app.
defineRpc uses this when an SSR pass calls a rpc in-process; the MCP
dispatcher uses it when piping a tool invocation through rpc.fetch.

WARNING — this is an allowlist: every inbound header NOT named here (and
not added via app.forwardHeaders) is DROPPED on the in-process path. A
handler that reads e.g. `accept-language`, an idempotency key, a trace
header, or a custom `x-tenant-*` during SSR or an MCP call sees nothing,
and the call still succeeds with a degraded request. Add the names you
rely on via the `forwardHeaders` export in src/app.ts.

Centralised so both call sites can't drift on which headers are
considered "auth/identity" context.
