/*
Memoises an async loader keyed by string: the first call for a key starts the
load and caches its promise; later calls reuse it. `load` returns undefined when
the key has no loader, which is passed through (and not cached) so the caller can
treat "unknown key" distinctly from "loaded value". Used by the rpc-module and
socket-module load caches, which share this exact shape.
