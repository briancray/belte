/*
Compiles a selector into an entry predicate shared by cache.invalidate(),
pending(), and refreshing() so all three interpret the call shapes identically:
  undefined            → every entry
  remote fn            → that function's calls (method+url prefix). `arg.url` is
                         the route template; per-call args appear as `?...`
                         (GET/DELETE) or after a space (canonical-json body) —
                         see keyForRemoteCall. `fn` and `fn.raw` match the same
                         set since they share method+url.
  producer fn          → that producer's calls (reference id prefix). Matches
                         only if the producer was cached at least once (else it
                         has no id and nothing matches).
  { scope }            → any entry sharing one of the requested scope tags. An
                         empty selector matches nothing.
  fn + args            → exactly that call's entry (the key derived from the
                         same encoders the read path uses); other args
                         variants of the fn are untouched.
Fn-selector identity (prefix resolution + the cache()-wrapper throw) lives in
selectorPrefix, the prefix grammar in keyMatchesPrefix — both shared with the
probes' scoped lifecycle channels so a probe subscribes to exactly the entries
this predicate would match. A caller that already resolved the prefix (the
invalidate/probe paths derive it for their own use) passes it as
`precomputedPrefix` so the args encoding isn't re-derived per call.
