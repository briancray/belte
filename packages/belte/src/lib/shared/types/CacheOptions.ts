/*
Options for cache(). The key is always auto-derived (method+url+args for a remote
function, producer-reference+args for a plain producer): hoist a producer to a
stable reference to share its entry across calls. `ttl` is the
milliseconds-past-resolve that the entry stays live: omitted = forever, 0 =
dedupe only (entry dropped once the promise settles — the mutation idiom:
in-flight coalescing and pending() visibility, nothing retained), any other
number = TTL.
`tags` is a list of free-form labels grouping unrelated calls so one
`cache.invalidate({ tags })` drops every entry sharing any of them — list more
than one when a call belongs to multiple invalidation groups. A unique tag (e.g.
a uuid) shared by a set of calls gives them their own private invalidation group.

`global` opts the entry into the process-level store instead of the default
request-scoped one (server) — so a value computed in one request is reused by
later requests, e.g. memoising an external endpoint the server calls. Omit it
for per-request data: the default keeps a per-user response from leaking across
requests. Write only `global: true`; there is no `false` form. On the client
there is a single tab store, so the flag is a no-op there.

`swr` is stale-while-revalidate: it controls how a `cache.invalidate` hit on
this key is applied. Without it, an invalidate drops the entry and the next read
shows `pending()`. With it, the entry is kept and refetched in the background:
the existing (stale) value stays visible and `refreshing()` reports the
in-flight reload, so the reader never blanks. It governs only the
refetch-after-invalidate; the first fetch and arg-change fetches stay immediate.

`swr: true` revalidates immediately on every invalidate. The object form adds a
coalescing window, in ms, that collapses a burst (e.g. a socket spraying
`cache.invalidate`) into far fewer calls: `{ throttle: N }` refetches on the
leading edge then at most once per N ms while invalidations keep arriving;
`{ debounce: N }` refetches only after N ms of quiet. `swr` declares the call
safe to re-run unprompted: cache() throws at wrap time on throttle + debounce
set at once, on ttl: 0 (nothing retained, nothing to revalidate), and on a
non-replayable remote method (replaying a write is a state change disguised as a
refresh). Producers are uncheckable — declare `swr` only on a producer that is a
pure read.
