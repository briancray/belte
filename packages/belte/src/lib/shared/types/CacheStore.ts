/*
Cache map paired with a Svelte-aware per-key subscriber. Calling
`subscribe(key)` from inside a tracking scope ($derived / $effect) registers
that scope to re-run when the entry is invalidated; called outside tracking
it's a no-op. Subscribers live for the lifetime of the store: the server
uses a fresh store per request (so subscribers die with the response), the
client uses a single module-level store (so subscribers persist for the tab).

`trackLifecycle`/`markLifecycle` are the probes' lifecycle channels, scoped
by selector prefix. `trackLifecycle(prefix)` taps a channel keyed to that
fn selector's entries (see selectorPrefix), so a `pending(fn)` reader
re-derives only when fn's calls change state; `trackLifecycle()` taps the
store-wide channel — bare and tag selectors scan many entries, so they
(deliberately) wake on every event. `markLifecycle(key)` — fired whenever a
call starts, settles, is evicted, or is invalidated — marks the store-wide
channel plus every probed prefix channel owning `key`.

    cache() call is a cold miss with no memory it followed an invalidate; this set
    carries that signal across the gap so the replacement entry is flagged a reload
    (refreshing() true) rather than a first-ever load. Consumed when that entry is
    created. Bounded on the long-lived tab store from both ends: a marker is only
    added when `hasReader(key)` (no on-screen value → the next read is a first
    load, not a reload, so no marker), and a marker whose reader tears down before
    re-reading is pruned by the subscriber's cleanup. The server's request-scoped
    store discards the whole set with the response.
