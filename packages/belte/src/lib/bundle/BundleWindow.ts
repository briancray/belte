User-authored bundle window configuration, default-exported from an
optional `src/bundle/window.ts`. Baked into the launcher at build time
(via the `belte:bundle-window` virtual) and read directly in dev. Every
field is optional — the launcher falls back to the program name for the
title and to openWebview's defaults for size.

The standard App/Edit/Window menus (Quit, copy/paste, minimize/close) plus the
built-in File menu (Start server / Connect / Disconnect) are always installed.
`menu` adds custom top-level menus between the Edit and Window menus; their items
emit `belte:menu` events the app handles. See BundleMenuItem.

    Config the embedded server needs before it can run, as a Standard Schema (the
    same kind belte accepts for RPC/MCP). Its JSON Schema drives the connect
    screen's first-run form, shown as a modal when Start is clicked with a required
    key still unset; the user's answers persist to the data-dir `.env` the server
    loads at boot. Each property maps to one env var of the same name; `title` is
    the field label, `description` the hint, `format: 'password'` masks the input,
    and `default` pre-fills it.
