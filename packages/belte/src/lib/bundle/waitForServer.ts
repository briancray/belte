Polls an HTTP URL until it answers (any status) or the deadline passes.
The spawned server child binds asynchronously, so the launcher can't open
the webview until a request round-trips. A connection refusal throws and
is swallowed; once Bun.serve is listening the fetch resolves and we
return. Throws on timeout so the launcher can report a failed boot rather
than open a blank window.
