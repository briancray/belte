The port the embedded server binds. A `PORT` from the shell, the data-dir `.env`
(where the config form writes), or the shipped binary-dir `.env` is honored — so
the server answers at a fixed, known address another machine can reliably connect
to. With none set, the first open port at/above 3000 is chosen (matching the
standalone server's default). Precedence matches the server's own env stack:
shell > data-dir > binary-dir. A configured port is used as-is — if it's taken,
the bind failure surfaces rather than silently moving.

Spawns the sibling server binary on a free port and waits for it to answer,
returning the live URL plus the child so the caller owns its lifetime (reaping on
disconnect/exit). Readiness is raced against the child's exit so a server that
crashes on boot (missing config) surfaces immediately instead of stalling out
waitForServer's full timeout; the loser branch resolves (never rejects) so it
can't surface as an unhandled rejection once the child is later reaped. Does not
reap a previous child — the caller owns that.
