/*
Binds belte_request_navigate — points the live webview window at a URL from any
thread by hopping onto the UI thread via webview_dispatch. The launcher's control
server runs in a Worker (off the main thread that webview_run blocks), so when it
detects the connected server has died it uses this to bounce the window back to the
connect screen. macOS-only symbol (the Cocoa shim), so a failed lookup degrades to
a no-op — elsewhere the worker can still correct the menu flag, just not the window.

`handle` is the webview pointer created on the main thread, forwarded to the worker
as a number; bun:ffi accepts it for a ptr argument from either thread because the
pointer addresses the same process heap.
