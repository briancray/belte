/*
Binds belte_set_connected — the native flag the macOS Server menu's
validateMenuItem: reads to enable/disable Start/Disconnect. The symbol is
compiled only into the macOS lib (the Cocoa menu shim), so a failed lookup
degrades to a no-op setter rather than throwing on Linux/Windows.

The flag is a process-global, which is what lets the bundle's control server set
it from off the main thread: that server runs in a Worker because `webview_run`
blocks the main thread's JS event loop, yet the main-thread menu still reads the
same value through the shared dylib image. The returned close releases the handle.
