/*
Dev orchestrator. Replaces `bun --watch` (which only watches the import graph,
so new files / CSS / public assets never triggered a restart) with an explicit
loop we own end to end:

  1. Build the client once — uncompressed, unminified (zstd-22 on every rebuild
     dwarfs the bundle; the server serves the plain bytes when no .zst exists).
  2. Spawn the server as a child against a fixed dev port and BELTE_DEV=1, which
     makes it mount the /__belte/dev live-reload channel.
  3. Watch src/ recursively. On any change, rebuild then restart the child. SSR
     renders pages through Bun's module cache, so a fresh module graph (a new
     process) is the reliable way to reflect a source edit — Bun has no stable
     in-process invalidation. The browser reconnects to the restarted server's
     live-reload channel and reloads itself.

Restarts are serialized (a build mid-flight queues the next) and the port is
fixed so the browser tab stays valid across restarts. A failed build keeps the
last-good server running rather than tearing the loop down.
