only fn's prefix channel, so unrelated cache events — another function's
flights, invalidates, evictions — never re-run the reading scope. The hazard
this kills: an $effect that reads pending(a) and invalidates b used to be
re-woken by its own invalidate through the store-wide channel, looping across
microtasks where Svelte's depth detection can't see it.
