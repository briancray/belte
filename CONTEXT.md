# Domain language

Terms the code and its discussions use exactly. One meaning per term; sharpen here when a term drifts.

## Routing & rendering

**Route**
A page URL in readable bracket form (`/post/[id]`, `/docs/[...rest]`), derived from the `page.svelte` file's directory path. Translation to Bun's `:name` / `*` pattern syntax happens only at server registration; everywhere else the bracket form is the identity.

**View**
What a resolved route mounts: a page (or error) component plus the layout wrapping it — the shape of App.svelte's `state.render` slot.

**View resolution**
Route in, view out: nearest-layout selection plus the parallel page+layout module load. Owned by `createViewResolver` (`lib/shared/createViewResolver.ts`); the server renderer, the client navigator, and the surface diagnostics are its three callers. Prefix matching rules live nowhere else.

**Nearest-only layout**
The deepest `layout.svelte` prefix that is an ancestor of the route wins; layouts never stack. Errors follow the same rule (`error.svelte` per prefix).

**Page renderer**
Matched route in, finished SSR document (or JSON view payload) out: the svelte render, the inline-vs-streaming cache partition, the `__SSR__` state tag, shell splicing, and the error.svelte fallback. Owned by `createPageRenderer` (`lib/server/runtime/createPageRenderer.ts`); the route dispatcher and the 404 path are its callers. `createServer` is wiring, not behavior.

**Match**
URL → route + decoded params. Server-side only: Bun's router matches, the catch-all param is reconstructed from the pathname. The client never matches URLs — it asks the server (`Accept: application/json`) and receives `{ route, params }`.

## Cache & streaming

**Registry**
A store of registered async work with a lifecycle channel. There are two: the
cache (calls — request/tab store + process-level global store, entries keyed by
wire or reference identity) and the tail registry (streams, keyed by
`Subscribable.name`, with the window size `last` folded into the key).
Registries act: they coalesce identical in-flight calls
(always on; `ttl` is only the retention dial — `ttl: 0` is the mutation idiom,
retaining nothing beyond the store's atomic unit: the whole request on the
server, the in-flight window in the tab),
retain results, revalidate stale-in-place under an invalidate policy, and
reconnect a dropped stream with its last value retained.

**Probe**
A reactive read of registry state: `pending()` (no value yet — an in-flight
call, or a stream awaiting its first frame) and `refreshing()` (value held, a
fresher source in flight — a policy refetch, a drop-then-reload, or a stream
reconnecting; never a merely-open stream). Standalone modules
(`belte/shared/pending`, `belte/shared/refreshing`) spanning both registries
via the same selector grammar as `cache.invalidate` plus a Subscribable form.
Probes report, never act: reading one opens no fetch and no stream, and every
registry behavior works with zero probe readers. A proposed probe that would
need to trigger something is a registry feature wearing the wrong hat.
`cache.invalidate` stays attached to cache because its sentence is about the
cache (end retention early); `tail.status`/`tail.error` stay on
tail as the stream's richer state view.

**Tail**
The retained end of a stream, and the one word for reading it at every
altitude: a socket declared `{ tail: n }` retains its last n frames (omitted =
pure live pipe, storage is the consumer's concern); `chat.tail(count)` is the
raw read seeded from it (no-arg = the whole retained tail; bare iteration is
live-only — replay is exclusively tail's job); `tail(x)` is the reactive
latest-wins read and `tail(x, { last: n })` a live window of the last ≤n
frames, however they arrived. `last` is the read-side word (how much the
reader keeps), `tail` the declaration-side word (how much the topic retains);
`last` clamps to the declared `tail`. Retention exists for readers who weren't
there — late joiners, reconnect gaps, the CLI/MCP/SSE faces — which is why it
can't be delegated to consumers. Seeding rides `Subscribable.tail(count,
hooks?)`, an optional capability: sockets implement it verbatim, one-shot rpc
streams omit it, and the consumer never special-cases either. Replay is
demarcated on the wire: the seed arrives as one per-sub `replay` batch, so a
window commits atomically (no frame-by-frame rebuild), an empty replay keeps
the held window across a gap, and one sub's replay never leaks into siblings
on the same socket.

**Replayable method**
A remote method safe to re-issue without the caller asking: GET only
(`REPLAYABLE_METHODS`). Gates the SSR snapshot and the invalidate-policy
guard — a write never re-fires from hydration and never carries a policy.
(It does not gate the server's ttl: 0 keep: within one request, writes
coalesce like everything else.)

**Streaming protocol**
The SSR→client agreement for pending `{#await}` reads: the document ships `__SSR__.streaming` placeholders (`StreamingPlaceholder`) plus a single-use `streamToken`; the resolve channel (`RESOLVE_STREAM_PATH`) streams one `StreamedResolution` per entry — a `CacheSnapshotEntry` to settle warm, or a `{ key, miss }` marker meaning "re-fetch live". Keys derive from the route template via `keyForRemoteCall` on both sides. The protocol's shapes live in `lib/shared/types/`; its enforcement is the round-trip contract test (`tests/streamingRoundTrip.test.ts`), which feeds the server half's real output into the browser half. Streaming-vs-inline is chosen by `await` vs `{#await}` in the component — never by an option.

## Agents

**Engine**
A provider adapter satisfying `AgentEngine`: surface + neutral conversation in, `AgentFrame` stream out. It owns its own loop. Lives in `@belte/<provider>`, never in core.

**Frame**
One provider-neutral streaming event (`text` / `tool_use` / `tool_result` / `done`). The frame contract is what all engines must agree on.

**Frame conformance**
The invariants every engine's stream must satisfy — exactly one `done`, last; every `tool_use` answered by a same-id same-name `tool_result`. Encoded once in `belte/test/assertAgentFrameConformance`; each provider package runs it against scripted provider output (`belte/test/createScriptedSurface` records tool dispatches).
